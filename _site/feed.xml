&lt;p&gt;Curiosity signifies interest.  Best case scenario, I answer well and help establish a safe space for greater curiosity.  Worst case scenario, I answer poorly and stir up feelings of fear and resentment and accidentally help justify unsubstantiated biases.  One time I answered poorly and was met with a fist pounding the poker table and a very serious accusation: “&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; are the problem with this country!” I hoped to not make that mistake again.  I will choose my words more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m undergoing training to support peers through recovery in the small rural town in Idaho that I currently call home when I get a chance to try again. Don’t say &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, I remind myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I was little, I wanted to be a dolphin trainer; now, I train computers to do biology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’d &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; go over? I wonder, scanning the foreheads of those in earshot.  Too trite?  I worried. Raised eyebrows might suggest confusion or boredom or disbelief or curiosity.  I was relieved to spot eye wrinkles around slightly squinted eyes indicating happy surprise and a narrowing of distance between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/intro.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;What do you do?&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say, “The pen is mightier than the sword”. To me, jargon is merely weaponized social distancing, not of the variety that helps protect the most vulnerable during global pandemics, but the variety that fosters suspicion and distrust in education and science in the hearts of many voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe good communication, compelling stories, foster curiosity and help bring people closer together.  To this end, I’ve decided to blog to help craft my science communication skills and explore my narrative as a PhD student, lover of life, sustainability enthusiast, and human being. Here, you can find my stories of dreaming big and lessons learned through mistakes. Through this journey I hope to help create a safe space where everyone feels included in discussions on science, education, and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;‘re here and, with that, I ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just completed the two-day instructor training through The Carpentries alongside a few other colleages from Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. It was so refreshing to talk pedagogy. I’m excited about helping the University of Idaho host a few Software and Data Carpentries workshops in the Spring to help empower others to utilize programming and other computational tools to increase their research productivity.

&lt;p&gt;There were some difficulties coordinating its delivery to Moscow, which allowed me to add a couple additional days to my cross-country move to explore Yellowstone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad met up with me after my move, and I am so grateful!  He’s spent 40 years of his life working on RVs so was super helpful in helping me get settled into my Tiny, which is technically classified as an RV.  I had some helpful neighbors help me park my Tiny but I would’ve been lost in getting it properly leveled and Winter-ready.  Plus, he surprised me with the addition of a new tiny porch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented the bioinformatics approach I employed to identify putative venom allergen-like proteins from lots of flatworm transcriptomes and why I think understanding their diversification will be helpful for understanding the evolution of parasitism, particularly in this group.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve officially accepted the University of Idaho’s offer of admission into their Bioinformatics and Computational Biology PhD program!  This Florida girl will be trading the warmth and humidity of the Southeast for the drier, snowier weather home to the rolling hills of the Palouse in Northern Idaho. I’ll be the first in my family to move across the country, which is scary, especially doing so alone and to such a small, rural town, but Moscow gave off great vibes during my visit, and I’m ready for the challenge!  I’ll be working with Dr. Scott Nuismer and Dr. Luke Harmon on exploring coevolution within a phylogenetic framework.&lt;/p&gt;
