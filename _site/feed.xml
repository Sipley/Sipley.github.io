&lt;p&gt;There were some difficulties coordinating its delivery to Moscow, which allowed me to add a couple additional days to my cross-country move to explore Yellowstone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad met up with me after my move, and I am so grateful!  He’s spent 40 years of his life working on RVs so was super helpful in helping me get settled into my Tiny, which is technically classified as an RV.  I had some helpful neighbors help me park my Tiny but I would’ve been lost in getting it properly leveled and Winter-ready.  Plus, he surprised me with the addition of a new tiny porch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to announce that I’ve officially accepted the University of Idaho’s offer of admission into their Bioinformatics and Computational Biology PhD program!  This Florida girl will be trading the warmth and humidity of the Southeast for the drier, snowier weather home to the rolling hills of the Palouse in Northern Idaho. I’ll be the first in my family to move across the country, which is scary, especially doing so alone and to such a small, rural town, but Moscow gave off great vibes during my visit, and I’m ready for the challenge!  I’ll be working with Dr. Scott Nuismer and Dr. Luke Harmon on exploring coevolution within a phylogenetic framework.&lt;/p&gt;
