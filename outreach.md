I am passionate about providing educational opportunities to the severely underserved prison populations. To this end, I've volunteered with the [Alabama Prison Arts + Education Program](http://apaep.auburn.edu/). I began by volunteering as a math tutor for the degree program where I tutored 20 prisoners working towards a BS in Interdisciplinary Studies from Auburn University. This Spring, I am excited to help coordinate the SPARKs seminar series to bring weekly STEM lectures to Alabama prisoners.  You can support APAEP [here](https://secure.auburn.edu/s/1715/giving/index.aspx?sid=1715&gid=2&pgid=390&cid=1009&dids=82)!
