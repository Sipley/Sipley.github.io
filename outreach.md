I am passionate about providing educational opportunities to the severely underserved prison populations. To this end, I really enjoyed volunteering with the [Alabama Prison Arts + Education Program](http://apaep.auburn.edu/) while I was at Auburn. I got to serve as a math tutor for 20 prisoners working towards a BS in Interdisciplinary Studies from Auburn University, which has honestly been the coolest experience of my life. Later, I also got to help coordinate the SPARKs seminar series to bring weekly STEM lectures to Alabama prisoners. You can support APAEP [here](https://secure.auburn.edu/s/1715/giving/index.aspx?sid=1715&gid=2&pgid=390&cid=1009&dids=82)!
