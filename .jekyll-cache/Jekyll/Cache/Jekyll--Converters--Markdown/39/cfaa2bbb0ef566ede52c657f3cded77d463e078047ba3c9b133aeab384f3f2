I"í<p>I just moved to the University of Idaho to pursue my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology with <a href="https://www.leeef.org/">Scott Nuismer</a> (coevolutionary theory) and <a href="http://lukejharmon.github.io/">Luke Harmon</a> (phylogenetic comparative methods). I hope to help understand how species interactions affect diversification over macroevolutionary time by incorporating coevolutionary theory into phylogenetic models.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I completed my MS with <a href="http://phyletica.org/">Jamie R. Oaks</a> (theoretical phylogenetics) at Auburn University, where I studied the diversification of venom allergen-like proteins in flatworms and my BS at the University of Florida with <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/gustav-paulay/">Gustav Paulay</a> (molecular phylogenetics and systematics) assessing species limits in a morphologically diverse genus of sea cucumbers.</p>

<p>Native to Central Florida, I spent my childhood exploring the maze of intricate trails my brother carved through our woods and teasing alligators on the St Johnâ€™s River. As the only of my siblings to graduate high school, I was proud to graduate from the University of Florida with highest honors and be recognized for my potential as a science leader by being awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Throughout my education, I witnessed first-hand how family income, academic opportunities, support, and expectations interact to define student outcomes. I discovered academic success depends, above all, on support and available opportunities. To this end, I am passionate about providing authentic and inclusive research experiences and academic support to nontraditional students and underrepresented populations in STEM.</p>
