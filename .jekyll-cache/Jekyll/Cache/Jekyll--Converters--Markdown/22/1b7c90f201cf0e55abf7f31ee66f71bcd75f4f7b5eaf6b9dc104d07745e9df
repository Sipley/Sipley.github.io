I"â<p>The question that simultaneusly elates and worries the budding scientist.</p>

<p>Curiosity signifies interest.  Best case scenario, I answer well and help establish a safe space for greater curiosity.  Worst case scenario, I answer poorly and stir up feelings of fear and resentment and accidentally help justify unsubstantiated biases.  One time I answered poorly and was met with a fist pounding the poker table and a very serious accusation: â€œ<em>You</em> are the problem with this country!â€ I hoped to not make that mistake again.  I will choose my words more carefully. Donâ€™t say <em>Evolution</em>, I remind myself.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m undergoing training to support peers through recovery in the small rural town in Idaho that I currently call home when I get a chance to try again.</p>

<p>â€œWhen I was little, I wanted to be a dolphin trainer; now, I train computers to do biology.â€</p>

<p>Howâ€™d <em>that</em> go over? I wonder, scanning the foreheads of those in earshot.  Too trite?  I worried. Raised eyebrows might suggest confusion or boredom or disbelief or curiosity.  I was relieved to spot eye wrinkles around slightly squinted eyes indicating happy surprise and a narrowing of distance between us.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m a [air quotes] â€˜Computational Biologistâ€™, which is just a fancy way of saying I use computers as tools to help me understand life.â€ I paused to assess the space. â€œRight now, Iâ€™m interested in how interactions between things that are really different, like hosts and parasites, might change over time.â€  I could tell it was time to stop talking and make space for questions. We had a pleasant back-and-forth. It was warm and kind and I felt valued.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried versions of this approach a few times now while volunteering or chatting with fellows in the community and, while it can benefit from some tailoring, Iâ€™m happy with it.</p>

<p>My most recent audience actually included three scientists and a philsopher, which brings me to celebrating my latest milestone: completing my first committee meeting for my PhD!  A couple weeks ago, I successfully introduced what Iâ€™m imagining as my dissertation chapters and outlined my goals over the next 4ish years and specifically for the next semester.  Iâ€™ll save those for a later blog post.</p>

<p>Until then, Iâ€™ll leave you with this:  Iâ€™m choosing to blog to help craft my science communication skills.  They say, â€œThe pen is mightier than the swordâ€. Likewise, to me, jargon is merely weaponized social distancing, not of the variety that helps protect the most vulnerable during global pandemics, but the variety that fosters suspicion and distrust in education and science in the hearts of many voters.  My intention and greatest ambitions are that these blog posts will serve as a safe space to learn and share science much more broadly and effectively with family, friends, and fellow humans. To this end, I hope to develop a habit of one blog post a week. I will make mistakes and pledge to learn from them. I welcome help holding myself accountable to this commitment, as well as any and all questions, comments, thoughts, and feedback.</p>
