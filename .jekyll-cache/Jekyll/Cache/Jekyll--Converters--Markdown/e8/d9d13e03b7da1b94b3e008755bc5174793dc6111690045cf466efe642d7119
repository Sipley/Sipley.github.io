<p>The question that simultaneusly elates and worries the budding scientist.</p>

<p>Curiosity signifies interest.  Best case scenario, I answer well and help establish a safe space for greater curiosity.  Worst case scenario, I answer poorly and stir up fear and help justify insubstantiated biases.  One time, I answered poorly and was met with a fist pounding the poker table and a very serious accusation: â€œYou are the problem with this country.â€ I hoped to not make that mistake again.  I will choose my words more carefully. â€œDonâ€™t say â€˜Evolutionâ€™â€, I remind myself.</p>

<p>â€œWhen I was little, I wanted to be a dolphin trainer, now I train computers to do biologyâ€.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/intro.png" alt="&quot;What do you do?&quot;" /></p>

<p>â€œHowâ€™d that go over?â€ I wonder, scanning the foreheads of those in earshot.  Raised eyebrows might suggest confusion or boredom or disbelief or curiosity.  I was relieved to see eye wrinkles around slightly squinted eyes indicating happy surprise and a narrowing of distance between us.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m a computational biologist, which is just a fancy way of saying, I use computers as tools to help me answer hard questions.  Right now Iâ€™m interested in how interactions between things that are really different, like hosts and parasites, might change over time.â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried versions of this approach a few times now while volunteering or chatting with fellows in the community and, while it can benefit from some tailoring, Iâ€™m happy with it for now.  My most recent audience actually included three scientists and a philsopher, which brings me to celebrating my latest milestone: completing my first committee meeting for my PhD!</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I successfully introduced what Iâ€™m imagining as my dissertation chapters and outlined my goals over the next 4ish years and the next semester.  Iâ€™ll save those for a later blog post.</p>

<p>Until then, Iâ€™ll leave you with this:  Iâ€™m choosing to blog to help craft my science communication skills.  Itâ€™s hard to learn these skills from scientists â€“ often kings and queens of jargon. They say the pen is mightier than the sword. Likewise, to me, jargon is merely weaponized social distancing, not of the the variety that helps keep the most vulnerable safe during global pandemics, but the variety that encourages suspiciousness in education and science in the hearts of many voters.  My intention and greatest ambitions is these blog posts will help me learn how to communicate science much more broadly with family, friends, and fellow humans. To this end, I hope to develop a habit of one blog post a week and welcome help holding myself accountable to this commitment, as well as any and all questions and feedback.</p>
