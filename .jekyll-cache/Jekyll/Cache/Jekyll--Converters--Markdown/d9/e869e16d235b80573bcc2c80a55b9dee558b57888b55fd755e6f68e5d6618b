I"›<p>I am passionate about providing educational opportunities to the severely underserved prison populations. To this end, I volunteer with the <a href="http://apaep.auburn.edu/">Alabama Prison Arts + Education Program</a>. I began by volunteering as a math tutor for the degree program where I tutored 20 prisoners working towards a BS in Interdisciplinary Studies from Auburn University. This Spring, I am excited to help coordinate the SPARKs seminar series to bring weekly STEM lectures to Alabama prisoners.  You can support APAEP <a href="https://secure.auburn.edu/s/1715/giving/index.aspx?sid=1715&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=390&amp;cid=1009&amp;dids=82">here</a>!</p>
