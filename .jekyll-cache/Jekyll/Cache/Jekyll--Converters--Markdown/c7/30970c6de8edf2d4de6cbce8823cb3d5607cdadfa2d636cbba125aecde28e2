I"<p>I am passionate about providing educational opportunities to the severely underserved prison populations. To this end, I really enjoyed volunteering with the <a href="http://apaep.auburn.edu/">Alabama Prison Arts + Education Program</a> while I was at Auburn. I got to serve as a math tutor for 20 prisoners working towards a BS in Interdisciplinary Studies from Auburn University, which has honestly been the coolest experience of my life. Later, I also got to help coordinate the SPARKs seminar series to bring weekly STEM lectures to Alabama prisoners. You can support APAEP <a href="https://secure.auburn.edu/s/1715/giving/index.aspx?sid=1715&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=390&amp;cid=1009&amp;dids=82">here</a>!</p>
