I"<p>The question that simultaneusly elates and worries the budding scientist.</p>

<p>Curiosity signifies interest.  Best case scenario, I answer well and help establish a safe space for greater curiosity.  Worst case scenario, I answer poorly and stir up feelings of fear and resentment and accidentally help justify unsubstantiated biases.  One time I answered poorly and was met with a fist pounding the poker table and a very serious accusation: “<em>You</em> are the problem with this country!” I hoped to not make that mistake again.  I will choose my words more carefully.</p>

<p>I’m undergoing training to support peers through recovery in the small rural town in Idaho that I currently call home when I get a chance to try again. Don’t say <em>Evolution</em>, I remind myself.</p>

<p>“When I was little, I wanted to be a dolphin trainer; now, I train computers to do biology.”</p>

<p>How’d <em>that</em> go over? I wonder, scanning the foreheads of those in earshot.  Too trite?  I worried. Raised eyebrows might suggest confusion or boredom or disbelief or curiosity.  I was relieved to spot eye wrinkles around slightly squinted eyes indicating happy surprise and a narrowing of distance between us.</p>

<p>I’m choosing to blog to help craft my science communication skills.  They say, “The pen is mightier than the sword”. Likewise, to me, jargon is merely weaponized social distancing, not of the variety that helps protect the most vulnerable during global pandemics, but the variety that fosters suspicion and distrust in education and science in the hearts of many voters.  My intention and greatest ambitions are that these blog posts will serve as a safe space to learn and share science much more broadly and effectively with family, friends, and fellow humans. To this end, I hope to develop a habit of one blog post a week. I will make mistakes. I pledge to learn from them. I welcome help holding myself accountable to this commitment, as well as any and all questions, comments, thoughts, and feedback.</p>
