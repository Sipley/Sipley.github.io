I"<p>Moscow, Idaho—not Moscow, Russia.</p>

<p>I’m excited to announce that I’ve officially accepted the University of Idaho’s offer of admission into their Bioinformatics and Computational Biology PhD program!  This Florida girl will be trading the warmth and humidity of the Southeast for the drier, snowier weather home to the rolling hills of the Palouse in Northern Idaho. I’ll be the first in my family to move across the country, which is scary, especially doing so alone and to such a small, rural town, but Moscow gave off great vibes during my visit, and I’m ready for the challenge!  I’ll be working with Dr. Scott Nuismer and Dr. Luke Harmon on exploring coevolution within a phylogenetic framework.</p>

<p>Now, to just finish up and defend my MS thesis…</p>
