Did I mention I bought a Tiny Home?!  

There were some difficulties coordinating its delivery to Moscow, which allowed me to add a couple additional days to my cross-country move to explore Yellowstone! 

My Dad met up with me after my move, and I am so grateful!  He's spent 40 years of his life working on RVs so was super helpful in helping me get settled into my Tiny, which is technically classified as an RV.  I had some helpful neighbors help me park my Tiny but I would've been lost in getting it properly leveled and Winter-ready.  Plus, he surprised me with the addition of a new tiny porch!

Time to get ready for Orientation...
