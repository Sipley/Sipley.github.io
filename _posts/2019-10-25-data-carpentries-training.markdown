I just completed the two-day instructor training through The Carpentries alongside a few other colleages from Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. It was so refreshing to talk pedagogy. I'm excited about helping the University of Idaho host a few Software and Data Carpentries workshops in the Spring to help empower others to utilize programming and other computational tools to increase their research productivity. Be on the lookout for more info!
