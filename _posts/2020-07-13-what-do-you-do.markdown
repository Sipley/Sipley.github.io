The question that simultaneusly elates and worries the budding scientist.  

Curiosity signifies interest.  Best case scenario, I answer well and help establish a safe space for greater curiosity.  Worst case scenario, I answer poorly and stir up feelings of fear and resentment and accidentally help justify unsubstantiated biases.  One time I answered poorly and was met with a fist pounding the poker table and a very serious accusation: "*You* are the problem with this country!" I hoped to not make that mistake again.  I will choose my words more carefully. 

I'm undergoing training to support peers through recovery in the small rural town in Idaho that I currently call home when I get a chance to try again. Don't say *Evolution*, I remind myself.

"When I was little, I wanted to be a dolphin trainer; now, I train computers to do biology." 

How'd *that* go over? I wonder, scanning the foreheads of those in earshot.  Too trite?  I worried. Raised eyebrows might suggest confusion or boredom or disbelief or curiosity.  I was relieved to spot eye wrinkles around slightly squinted eyes indicating happy surprise and a narrowing of distance between us.

They say, *The pen is mightier than the sword*. To me, *scientific jargon* functions as weaponized people distancing. Not to be confused with social distancing, which aims to help protect the most vulnerable during global pandemics, *people distancing*, I believe, is rooted in a belief in othering and, likewise, unsurpisingly breeds suspicion and distrust in education and science in the hearts of many eligible voters. 

I believe good communication and compelling stories instead foster curiosity and help bring people closer together.  To this end, I've decided to blog to help craft my science communication skills and explore my narrative as a PhD student, lover of life, and human being. Here, you can find my stories of dreaming big and lessons learned through my own mistakes. Through this journey, I hope to help create a safe space where everyone feels included in discussions on science, education, and well-being. 

With that, I'd like *you* to know I'm glad you're here!
