"I'm a [air quotes] 'Computational Biologist', which is just a fancy way of saying I use computers as tools to help me understand life." I paused to assess the space. "Right now, I'm interested in how interactions between things that are really different, like hosts and parasites, might change over time."  I could tell it was time to stop talking and make space for questions. We had a pleasant back-and-forth. It was warm and kind and I felt valued.

I've tried versions of this approach a few times now while volunteering or chatting with fellows in the community and, while it can benefit from some tailoring, I'm happy with it.  

My most recent audience actually included three scientists and a philsopher, which brings me to celebrating my latest milestone: completing my first committee meeting for my PhD!  A couple weeks ago, I successfully introduced what I'm imagining as my dissertation chapters and outlined my goals over the next 4ish years and specifically for the next semester.  I'll save those for a later blog post.
