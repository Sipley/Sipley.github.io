I passed my MS defense! I feel so fortunate to have had so many friends and colleagues come out to support me. I presented the bioinformatics approach I employed to identify putative venom allergen-like proteins from lots of flatworm transcriptomes and why I think understanding their diversification will be helpful for understanding the evolution of parasitism, particularly in this group.  My hope is my pipeline may be helpful to others interested in exploring gene family evolution using large molecular datasets.
